#4. Alice, Bob and Carol have agreed to pool their Halloween candy and split it evenly among themselves.
#  For the sake of their friendship, any candies left over will be smashed. For example, 
# if they collectively bring home 91 candies, they'll take 30 each and smash 1.
#Write an arithmetic expression below to calculate how many candies they must smash for a given haul.

# solution
alice_candies = 121
bob_candies = 77
carol_candies = 109

to_smash = (alice_candies + bob_candies + carol_candies) % 3

print(to_smash)
